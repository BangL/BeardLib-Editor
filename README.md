Help would be really appreciated in the wiki!

## Before you stop reading!
This mod has two dependencies, [BLT](https://paydaymods.com/download/)/[SuperBLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz) and [BeardLib](https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=14924), without them the editor will not run, make sure you have both of them with their latest version.

Sadly, the game has one issue which doesn't allow selecting some things in the game, this is fixed with either SuperBLT or a PDMOD that you can get here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hwjimqxjg7ehrmm/BeardLibEditor%20Physics%20Fix.pdmod?dl=0
