# BeardLib-Editor

BeardLib-Editor is a mod that uses the amazing library called BeardLib to allow editor-like features!

## Editor? For what?
Bunch of stuff, currently most apparent is the level editor including the environment editor!

don't know how to? Begin reading the guide in here https://modworkshop.net/wiki.php?action=view&id=15

## Before you stop reading!
In order for the mod to fully work, you'll need to make sure you have those two:

* BeardLib: https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=14924
* Physics settings fix: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hwjimqxjg7ehrmm/BeardLibEditor%20Physics%20Fix.pdmod?dl=0 

Mostly you only need BeardLib to run the mod. However, the fix makes sure you can select almost anything in the map, so install that too.
