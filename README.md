# BeardLib-Editor

BeardLib-Editor is a mod that uses the amazing library called BeardLib to allow editor-like features!

## Editor? For what?
Bunch of stuff, currently most apparent is the level editor including the environment editor!

## Level Editor?
Yep! You can create new levels from scratch using BeardLib-Editor
don't know how to? Begin reading the guide in here https://modworkshop.net/wiki.php?action=view&id=15

## Before you stop reading!
In order for the mod to fully work, you'll need to make sure you have those two:
* SuperBLT(allows the fix to run without bundle modder): https://superblt.znix.xyz/ OR Physics settings fix: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hwjimqxjg7ehrmm/BeardLibEditor%20Physics%20Fix.pdmod?dl=0
* BeardLib: https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=14924

Mostly you only need BeardLib to run the mod. However, the fix makes sure you can select almost anything in the map, so install that too.

If you don't know how to install the physics settings fix you can learn here:
