# BeardLib-Editor

BeardLib-Editor is a mod that uses the amazing library called BeardLib to allow editor-like features!

## Editor? For what?
Currently the level and environment editor are present. There are plans for effect, unit, object and material config editors and many more.

## Multiplayer
The mod disables matchmaking with normal users, you cannot play with players that don't have the editor.
This is done to prevent playing with different physics settings which can mess up the game of the host/clients.
You can either disable the editor or rename supermod.xml (the physics settings fix) to be able to play with others (which will disable the physics settings fix)

## Level Editor?
Yep! You can create new levels from scratch using BeardLib-Editor.

## Before you stop reading!
This mod has two dependencies, [SuperBLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz) and [BeardLib](https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=14924), without them the editor will not run, make sure you have both of them with their latest version.

Additionally, you should extract the game files using [Bundle Modder](https://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=197) this will let the editor to fully work without anything missing, if the extract path is different, you can set the correct directory through the options of the editor.
